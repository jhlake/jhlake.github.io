This is my personal web page, developed for the purpose of a web developing course in the University of Los Andes.

I used bootstrap for collums, rows and general organization. My navegation bar and header (banner) are based on bootstrap's implementation of a Nav-bar.

I used https://miketricking.github.io/bootstrap-image-hover/ to base my image hovering tools and tricks.
I used https://codepen.io/crendon213wp/pen/PpYdNp to take part of the social media footer. Edited it.
ALL fonts are credited in the metadata as part of google's public font bank.
The progress bar was implemented based on w3schools tutorials.
All images used are either mine or from public domains.
